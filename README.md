# Photoboard: The best way to share your experiences!

## Our Purpose:
The purpose of our wesbite is to help students stay organized, both virtually and in real life. Our website offers embeds to important sites such as Google Drive, Canvas, or Synergy. We also offer To-Do Lists or Reminders to help students stay on task throughout the day.

Overview
Congratulations! This is the first step in your journey towards a career in full-stack web development. There are many paths that you can take in this field and this unit is the foundation for all of them. Every full-stack web developer must master HTML and CSS, as well as learn how to program browsers, servers, and databases.

You have several choices for the programming language that you use for building and deploying full-stack web applications, including JavaScript, PHP, and Python. This course focuses on JavaScript. Weâ€™ll use it to program both the browser (aka the client) and the server.

Regardless of the programming language you use, two tools that every developer uses on a daily basis are the command line and version control. The command line allows developers to quickly and efficiently interface with their operating system and software. To begin, we'll use the command line to navigate the file tree and create directories and files. Later, we'll use it to install software dependencies and run servers, among other tasks. Version control is an approach to managing changes in files without the need to make multiple copies of those files. We'll learn Git, which is the most popular version control system. Git integrates with GitHub.com, a site for developers to host and share their code. We will deploy our first website using GitHub Pages.

The first, and perhaps most important, file we'll create is index.html, which is the default entry point for any web application. All of our subsequent work will build on this initial starting point. The file suffix .html refers to HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language. HTML allows us to format webpages and text in a similar way to how a word processor formats documents and the text inside them. However, the biggest difference between HTML and a word processor is the ability to link between any document that's on the web, anywhere in the world. This is the "hypertext" in HTML.

Though HTML is enough to create a simple website, it falls a bit short in the design department. So we'll add color, fonts, and element positioning by adding CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to our HTML files to make them visually dynamic. In the next unit, we'll learn CSS frameworks that can expedite our development process.

Subsequent units will build on this foundation of HTML, CSS, and version control as we add JavaScript, servers, and databases to our stack to build interactive web applications.

## Project History:
Our website on project is built off of "flask_portfolio_hackers", the repository that Jakub and Tristan used in Trimester 1. However, besides basic layouts, are website and project is different, as it offers a completely new and unrelated theme. Our work on this project started at the beginning of Trimester 2.
